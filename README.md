# Override
from texteditor or console  

you can pass some operators without taking care of the context  
the context is given after you click the icon in the header and then the target area  
for example 3D View  

if you are in console a temporary text is created in text editor  
to excecute your command from the text editor  
console couldn't be overriden directly :(   

if you click a wrong context (so an aera)
a message appears Wrong context

N.B: for the moment C. and D. are not taken into account from the console


happy coding
